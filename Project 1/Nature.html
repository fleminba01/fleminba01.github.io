        <p>Viist Curaçao's two most popular national parks. Christoffel National Park and Shete Boka National Park are located on the north side of the island and are very close to each other. You can visit both on the same day.</p>

        <h3>Christoffel National Park</h3>
        <p>Mount Christoffel, in Christoffel National Park, is Curaçao’s tallest mountain, standing at 1,220 feet. Start your hike early to avoid as much heat as possible. They actually require you to start your hike by 10am to prevent getting overheated. 

            This hike is no joke! While the temperature may be fine while hiking, the humidity can be very high. You will also be climbing about 870 feet in a mile, with the trail getting steeper as you go. </p>

        <h3>Shete Boka National Park</h3>
        <p>Shete Boka National Park is a protected area of multiple inlets along the coast where turtles nest. Located on the rocky coast on the northern side of the island, waves crash into the inlets creating a magical show. It really is a unique experience!</p>

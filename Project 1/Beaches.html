        <p>Travelers come to Curaçao every year to experience its year-round warm weather, dry, desert-like landscape, and turquoise water. The island is located in the southern Caribbean, 40 miles north of the South American coast, enjoying an average temperature of 86 degrees. It’s the beaches that draw travelers to this corner of the Caribbean. While each beach has its own unique look and feel, it’s the signature “cove”-like shape that makes Curaçao’s beaches extra special. Rugged limestone cliffs create a sense of seclusion and serve as a contrast to the white sand beaches and tranquil, turquoise waters. Here are some of the best beaches in Curaçao to include on your next visit.</p>

        <h3>Sea Aquarium Beach (Mambo Beach)</h3>
        <p>Part beach, part boulevard, think of Mambo as an urban oasis set against a beach backdrop. It’s located just four miles south of Willemstad and is more built up than Curaçao’s other beaches. Mambo Beach does a good job of exuding popular appeal while maintaining a local feel. Whether you’re in the mood to bar hop or snorkel, there’s something for every taste and temperament. It’s a “choose your own adventure” type of place.</p>
        <p>Families will enjoy a visit to the Sea Aquarium—one of the best aquariums in the world—where adventurous visitors can snorkel in the natural lagoon alongside stingrays, sharks, and tarpon. In another area of the park, visitors see nurse sharks and lemon sharks up close, while feeding them through designated windows. When you’ve worked up an appetite, take your pick of Mambo Beach’s many restaurants. Bliss the Berry is a new addition to the boulevard and specializes in all-day breakfast and lunch—think fresh smoothies, açaí bowls, pancakes, and fresh roasted coffee. In the evening, head over to Chill beach bar for a front-row seat to the sunset. The bar is located right on the beach and set up with plenty of wooden tables and comfy hammocks. Order something off the grill, like their chicken, beef, or shrimp skewers or go all out with their “Chill” burger, served with a side of nachos.</p>

        <h3>Playa Kenepa Grandi (Grote Knip)</h3>
        <p>Kenya Grandi, also known as Grote Knip, is one of two beaches that make up Playa Kenepa. Grote Knip has an intimate feel to it, framed by cliffs at either end and backed by dense green shrub, and is a perfect place to disconnect from the world for an afternoon. Chill out on one of the loungers and catch some rays, or go on a kayak or snorkel adventure. As with more remote, quiet beaches, you’ll find a snack bar here but not much else. Consider packing a lunch or bringing some snacks with you.</p>
        <p>South of Grote Knip you’ll find Klein Knip, the other beach that makes up Playa Kenapa. This beach is smaller in size but stunning in its own way. The two beaches aren’t too far apart, so it’s possible to squeeze a visit to Klein Knip on the way.</p>
